# [Continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function)

Continuity is present within a function that does not display itself volatile under subtle argument variations.
<br>
Abrupt value changes, assuming small input variability, would imply discontinuity.

This, a core concept within calculus and mathematical analysis, is present where
arguments/values in functions are real & complex numbers.

The concept of continuity has been generalized to functions between metric spaces
and between topological spaces.
