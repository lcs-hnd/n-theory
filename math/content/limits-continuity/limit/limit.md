# [Limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics))
The value that a function (or sequence) approaches
as the sequence (or index) approaches some value.

Limits describe the behavior of functions as an argument is approached regardless of the actual value of said function at that given point.

### [Enumeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration)
Although contextually dependant, 
can be seen as a complete ordered listing of all the items in a collection.
