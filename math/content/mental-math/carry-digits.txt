when dividing or multiplying large numbers, often carry digits are generated
e.g. 68 + 59 = 127, thus you carry 1

encode the carry as a tag as +1, mentally attached to the next column
without storing the interim sum...
aka, instead of filling memory slots with 127, you use one slot for the carry 1 tag
and the rest is offloaded into working notations or visualization
