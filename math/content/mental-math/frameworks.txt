- pre mem building blocks
23*17 into a chunk (20 + 3)(20 - 3) = 400 - 9

- chunking + compression
rather than sotring all intermediate digits, they're compressed into results
like meaningful patterns
e.g. carry7 as a tag rather than a string of numbers

- use of codes
phonological loops such as silently rehearsing intermediate numbers
visuospatial imagery like seeing columns of digits or shapes of numbers
rythm or melodic codes like tapping out carries

- attention control drills
practicing holding partial results while switching focus rapidly
e.g. solving while being distracted : trains refresh strength before decay

- offloading complexity into rules
memorizing shortcuts (e.g. when you need to multiply by 5, just halve and multiply by 10)

layered strategies, automaticity, and chunking

** decay
** refresh
** carries
