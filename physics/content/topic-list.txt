PEMDAS

use EE/Exp key on a scientific calculator to represent (x10) for numbers expressed in s. notation
- perform (dfrag{2.5 * 10^3}{8.6 * 10^-5})

calculating area of different shapes

understand scientific notation, express 8.26 x 10^-3 in decimal form

determine an induced electromotive force in a loop at a specific time during its motion
- (uniformly rotating circular loop, loop with area of 0.5m^2, 10 turns of wire, constant & uniform 0.7 T magnetic field) (electromotive force 5 seconds into the motion)

determine an electric field in an infinite cylinder of radius R and uniform surface charge density
- utilize gauss' law, assume a positive surface charge

système international d'unités (SI), or the International System of Units, allows for technical info to be communicated across different mediums. **multiples** and **submultiples** are used when reducing numbers for convenience. they are obtained by combining the name of the unit the prefixes deka, hecto, kilo, deci, centi, and milli
- convert units throughout SI (11 Amperes into hectoAmperes)

convert zorgs into tubs

obtain cross products of given vectors and degrees (alongside their relation to axis)
- (A⃗ : magnitude 10, B⃗ : magnitude 20, both 10 degrees to the positive x axis)

calculator scalar products of given vectors
- (A⃗ =−3x−2y+z, B⃗ =2x+y−5z)

scaling numbers given units
- solve for milligrams of dye needed (solution needs 34mg in 250mL of water, if using only 95mL of water how much mg?)

simplify dfrag{a^-2}{a^6}

solve for hydronium ion concentration in a solution given pH, quantity, and equation used to express its relationship between pH and ion concentration (in units of molarity, M)
- (pH = log[H_3O^+], 650.0mL, pH of 6.85)

solve for R
- (PV = nRT)

solve for x given log involvement
