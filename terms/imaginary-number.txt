# an imaginary number is the product of a real number and the imaginary unit i
# when squared it will give a negative result

i is defined as i = √-1
obviously not a real number as squaring any real number never yields a negative 
i is defined by its property i² = -1

the square of an imaginary number bi is -b²
e.g. 5i, an imaginary number, has a square of -25

imaginary numbers allow us to find the square root of any negative number
​​​​
0 is considered to be both real and imaginary
